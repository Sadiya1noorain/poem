        <h1>Lonely</h1>
        <ul>

        Loneliness is my partner ðŸ¤—<br>
        Calmness is my soul <br>
        Lonely are the nights  <br>
        Lonely are the days <br>

        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Lonely I'm in so many ways </li>
            <li>Lonely are the seasons</li>
            <li>Lonely are the years</li>
            <li>So lonely I'm that brings tears</li>
        </ul>

        Lonely is this place <br>
        Lonely is my life <br>
        Lonely I am that I reach for a knife  <br>

        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Lonely is this court room </li>
            <li>Lonely is my sentence</li>
            <li>So lonely I am that I ask for repentance</li>
        </ul>
        
        Days passed I met a new companion <br>
        It's my loneliness <br>
        It's with me all the time <br>
        Like my soul of sorrow <br>

        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Why did no one tell me that this place existed? </li>
            <li>That so much peace can be found in loneliness</li>
            <li>I always thought I needed the crowd to be accepted </li>
        </ul>
    
        And here I walk alone happily rejected <br>
        I don't know why others complain <br>
        It's quite beautiful here <br>

        <ul class="margin">
            <li>Too much noise is unneeded, many fake cares </li>
            <li>Yes I misunderstand, so others think I'm rude </li>
            <li>That I find lonely lovely, such bliss in solitude ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒ </li>
        </ul>
